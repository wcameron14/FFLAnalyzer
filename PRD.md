# Fantasy Football League Analyzer - Product Requirements Document
## I. Introduction
The Fantasy Football League Analyzer is a Python-based application that fetches, stores, and analyzes data from the Sleeper API. The application aims to provide fantasy football league managers with insights into their leagues, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize their strategies.

## II. Current State of the Application
The application, as it currently stands, focuses on data acquisition and storage. It fetches a variety of data from the Sleeper API, including user data, league data, player data, roster data, matchup data, and transaction data. This data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, with different types of data stored in different tables. The codebase is organized into several Python modules, each handling a specific aspect of the application's functionality. The application runs in Docker containers and uses environment variables for configuration.

## III. Future Plans
The next steps for the application involve building out the logic for using the collected data, creating a user interface, and preparing for deployment. The application aims to provide a variety of analysis and visualization features, such as identifying patterns in league manager behavior, determining the "winner" of a trade, and generating player profiles. A key planned feature is a draft companion that observes a live draft and makes recommendations based on roster construction and past performance. A natural language processing (NLP) model could be used to allow users to ask questions of the data in plain English. The application will eventually be deployed to a cloud platform and will need to be able to handle multiple users.

## IV. Approach
The approach to building this application involves several key principles:

*Modularity*: The codebase is organized into separate modules, each handling a specific aspect of the application's functionality. This makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and expand.

*Error Handling*: The application is designed to handle errors gracefully, allowing the data collection process to continue even if there's an issue with a particular operation.

*Scalability*: The application uses a PostgreSQL database to store data, which can handle large amounts of data and scale as needed. The application is also Dockerized, making it easier to deploy and scale.

*User-Centric Design*: The application is being designed with the end user in mind. The planned user interface will allow users to easily explore the data, conduct analyses, and get insights.

## V. Conclusion
The Fantasy Football League Analyzer is a powerful tool for fantasy football league managers, providing them with data-driven insights to optimize their strategies. With its robust data acquisition capabilities and planned analysis and visualization features, the application is poised to become a leading solution in the fantasy football analytics space.
